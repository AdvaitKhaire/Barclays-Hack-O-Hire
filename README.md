## Current Solution:
The problem statement which we chose for our project was related to the cybersecurity domain, Predicting and Forecasting Cyber Threats/Attacks.
We first decided to find out the novelty regarding the project, we decided to explore various past toolsa and new domains which were prone to cyber attacks but, in the end, we decided to work along the lines of Barclays as our client and decided to make a solution which shall suit them. 
The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly dashboard which shall present the current ongoing vulnerabilities in India and accordingly predict the future vulnerabilities accurately and present the data in a legible and concise format. 
We started working on the project by gathering all the publicly available data using web scraping tools such as Scrapy on Python, ParseHub and a few other open source tools. 
Once we'd collected the data, we analyzed it and identified the key factors given in the problem statement, then on, we had to clean it for which we again had to use Python's library called Pandas(Panel Data Analysis). After cleaning and filtering the datasets, we tried out different machine learning models which we had to train on our provided datasets, the models which we tried the datasets were: Random Forest and Linear Regression.
We got an accuracy of 61% using the random forest model, which showed that the model accurately predicted the attack with a precision of 61%. Following which, we made a dashboard of our project using Tableau and PowerBI, we properly illustrated our project using pie charts, map charts and line charts to make our dashboard and project more attractive and represented the data in a legible format.
